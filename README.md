CppAwait
========

CppAwait is a C++ library that enables writing asynchronous code in a natural (sequential) form.

It solves the code flow inversion typical of asynchronous APIs. So -- instead of chaining callbacks, dealing with state and error codes -- you can use plain conditionals, loops and exception handlers to express your asynchronous algorithm.

The goal: make it easier to write responsive applications that have to deal with laggy network & file I/O.


How it works
============

CppAwait provides an _await_ construct similar to the one from C# 5 (see [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx)). Upon reaching an _await_ expression the C# compiler automatically transforms the rest of the method into a task continuation. In C++ a similar effect can be achieved through coroutines (which CppAwait implements on top of Boost.Context). Calling _await()_ will suspend a coroutine until the associated task completes. The program is free to do other work while coroutine is suspended.

Your program needs a run loop to manage asynchronous operations.


Here is a snippet showing typical library use. It connects and transfers some data to a TCP server:

    ut::Awaitable awt;

    tcp::resolver::iterator outEndpoints;
    awt = ut::asio::asyncResolve(resolver, query, outEndpoints);
    awt.await();

    for (auto it = outEndpoints; it != tcp::resolver::iterator(); ++it) {
        tcp::endpoint ep = *it;
        awt = ut::asio::asyncConnect(socket, ep);

        try {
            awt.await();
            break; // connected
        } catch (const std::exception&) {
            // try next endpoint
        }
    }
    if (!socket.is_open()) {
        throw SocketError("failed to connect socket");
    }

    // write an HTTP request
    awt = ut::asio::asyncWrite(socket, request);
    awt.await();

    // read response
    awt = ut::asio::asyncReadUntil(socket, outResponse, std::string("\r\n"));
    awt.await();

The _Awaitable_ class is a generic wrapper for asynchronous operations. All asynchronous methods return an _Awaitable_. Its _await()_ method yields control to the main loop until the _Awaitable_ completes or fails, at which point the coroutine resumes. If operation failed the associated exception gets thrown. Note there is no return value -- output parameters such as _endpoints_ must be passed by reference.

_Awaitables_ compose easily, just like regular functions. More complex patterns are supported through _awaitAll()_ / _awaitAny()_.


Another snippet. Download and archive some files, allowing for archival while next download is in progress:

    std::vector<std::string> urls = { ... };

    ut::Awaitable awtArchive;

    for (std::string url : urls) {
        // holds fetched document
        std::unique_ptr<std::vector<char> > document;

        ut::Awaitable awtFetch = asyncFetch(url, &document);

        // doesn't block, instead it yields. the coroutine
        // gets resumed when fetch done or on exception.
        awtFetch.await();

        if (!awtArchive.isNil()) {
            awtArchive.await();
        }
        awtArchive = asyncArchive(std::move(document));
    }


There are several [examples](/Examples) included. See [stock client](/Examples/ex_stockClient.cpp) for a direct comparison between classic async and the await pattern.


Features
========

- coroutines, iterable generators

- composable awaitables

- support for exceptions

- can adapt any asynchronous API

- Boost.Asio wrappers

- pluggable into any program with a run loop

- good performance with stack pooling

- customizable logging

- portable


Installation
============

1. __Install [Boost](http://www.boost.org/users/download/).__ To use CppAwait you need Boost 1.57+ with _Boost.Context_, _Boost.Coroutine_ and _Boost.System_ compiled [[*]](#msvc10). Quick guide:

   - download Boost archive
   - ./bootstrap
   - ./b2 --build-type=minimal --with-context --with-coroutine --with-chrono --with-thread --toolset=your-toolset stage

2. __Install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) 2.8+__

3. __Build CppAwait__:

   - mkdir build\_dir ; cd build\_dir
   - cmake -G "your-generator" -DBOOST\_INCLUDEDIR="path-to-boost" -DBOOST\_LIBRARYDIR="path-to-boost-libs" "path-to-CppAwait"
   - open solution / make

<a id="msvc10">(*)</a> Visual C++ 2010 doesn't implement the thread library. In this case _Boost.Chrono_ and _Boost.Thread_ are also required to compile the examples.


Portability
===========

The library is supported on Windows / Linux with any of these compilers:

   - Visual C++ 2010 or later
   - GCC 4.6.2 or later

Boost.Context includes assembly code for ARM / MIPS / PowerPC32 / PowerPC64 / X86-32 / X86-64.

Porting to additional platforms (e.g. iOS, Android) should be trivial.
